看了快四季的suits，除了领略一下纽约西装革履的讼棍们的日常外，还是深有所感的。

首先，看美剧学英语，每一集的shit语简直之极灵魂深处：

```
I'm gonna beat the shit out of you.
You piece of shit.
I'm gonna fire the shit out of you.
Who you are in bed with.
He did some bad shit.
You and I don't mess shit up.
He sang like a canary. (告密的小婊砸)
I am god dammn do it.
You and Mike are gonna to work your shit out.
All he want to do is shake us down. (敲诈，就是把你拎起来然后把钱摇出来。)
He's the guy you shit bed with.
You evidence-manufacturing piece of shit.
```

```
Junior ==> Senior ==> Name partner.
We both know laywers are nothing but power-hungry bottom-feeders.
```

律所里有这么一位律师路易，心地纯良，但总是被他人利用其性格搞砸很多事，但每每让人感动的也是他啊。

```
There comes a time when a man must look at himself in the mirror, to judge himself instead of waiting to be judged by others.
```
